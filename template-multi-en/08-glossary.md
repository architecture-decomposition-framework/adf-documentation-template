# 8. Glossary

At last, we define terms that might be unclear to the target group of this document. Note that the extent and level of detail varies greatly depending on the level of knowledge of the target group. For example, it is not necessary to explain what a NoSQL database is to experienced developers, but it is more likely to be explained to management. Vice versa, there may be terminologies that are familiar to the business departments, but unknown to architects and developers.

_Term_: Definition, for example:

_CQRS_: Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation is a software design pattern that uses different data models and interfaces for write and read access of data. For more information, see [Martin Fowler's blog entry on the subject](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html).
