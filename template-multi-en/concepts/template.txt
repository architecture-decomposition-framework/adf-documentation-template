# Name of concept

Template for an architecture concept. Copy as "concept-name-lowercase.md", fill it out, and then run `update_concepts_table.sh`. We use the specific name of the solution concept as a heading, e.g. "Multi-tenancy concept", "Scalability", "Logging", "Testability", "Internationalization", "Monitoring", "Configuration", "Offline-usage and data synchronization".

It is important that there is a first paragraph directly after the #-heading (this will be used for the short description in [Architecture Concepts](../05-architecture-concepts.md)).

## Architecture drivers

It is sufficient to insert references to the drivers (e.g. the scenario ID).

## Solution idea

- What is the idea with this concept?

We illustrate the idea with architectural views and accompanying text.

## Design decisions

- What fundamental design decisions have we made for this solution concept? E.g. architecture style(s), technologies, frameworks, strategies

## Discarded alternatives

- Why were they rejected?
