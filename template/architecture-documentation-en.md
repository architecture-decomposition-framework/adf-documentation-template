## 1. Introduction

In the introduction, we create a basic understanding of the system for the reader. We describe the business context with underlying business goals for the system, provide a top-level overview of the system, identify constraints to be considered, and relevant stakeholders. In addition, we explain the goals of this document.

### 1.1. Business context

Each system is embedded in its business context. This section helps to understand this context in order to get a complete picture of the system and comprehend the design decisions.

Questions to be answered:

- What are the motivation and core drivers for the development of the system?
- What are particular challenges?
- What business goals are to be achieved or supported by the system?
- In which business or project context is the system embedded?
- What are the resulting tasks for the system?

### 1.2. System overview

We describe all the main features that would be listed on a (fictitious) product box for this software:

- What is the core idea behind this system/software?
- What are the most important functionalities of the system?
- What are the really important quality features of the system?
- What makes the system usable?

### 1.3. Constraints

- What are important constraints and specifications that have to be accepted as "fixed" or "given" during development? For example:
  - Domain constraints ("To be considered a medical system, the system must meet X, Y, Z").
  - Organizational constraints such as processes, team structure/size, security policies, open- or closed-source strategies
  - Technical constraints ("The system must use the existing Oracle database")
  - Legal constraints ("The system must be GDPR compliant")
  - Cost and time ("The system must be implemented by 2.2.2022 with a budget of â‚¬222,222.")
- What impact on development, quality assurance and operations can be directly derived from the constraints?
- Do the constraints apply to the system, a product family, or the entire company?

Note: We should always question the constraints, because

- they are often not as fixed as they may seem,
- they limit the solution space, and
- they may be outdated when the project finally starts.

### 1.4. Stakeholders

A stakeholder is a person or organization that (directly or indirectly) influences the requirements of a system or that is affected by the system.

- What are the key stakeholders of the system?
  - Internal and external stakeholders
  - Direct stakeholders such as: Users, operation staff, developers, test team, support team, ...
  - Indirect stakeholders such as: Managers, Marketing, ...
- What are the respective activities and responsibilities of each stakeholder?
- What are their respective concerns? That is, what is important to them in the system and what is their respective expectation?

### 1.5. Document goals

- What are the goals of the document?
- For which stakeholders does the document contain relevant information and where can each of these be found?
- What is the status of the system and this document?
  - Example: This documentation is a draft and describes a system that is still in the planning stage.
  - Or: This documentation is completed and describes the system version 2.3, which has been in operation since 15.7.2020.

## 2. System context and domain

In this chapter, we describe the context in which the system is used.

### 2.1. System context delineation

- How is the system embedded in its context?
- Which roles use the system and for what reason?
- What user interfaces does the system provide?
- With which external systems does the system interact?
- (How is the system integrated into its system landscape?)
- In which way does the system interact with external systems and which data is exchanged?

### 2.2. Domain model

- What are the entities (core elements from the business domain) in the system?
- What do the entities mean? What do they represent?
- How are the entities related to each other?
- How are the entities processed by the system?
- (Can subdomains be formed in which the entities each have a different meaning?)

## 3. Architecture drivers (Function and Quality)

The following chapters give an overview of the most important requirements for the system that influence architecture design. These requirements, called architecture drivers, include functional requirements and quality requirements (described in this chapter) as well as business goals and constraints (already described in chapter 1).

### 3.1. 3.1 Key functional requirements

- What are the most important functional requirements for the system?
- What must the system be able to do at its core?
- Which functions cannot be left out?

### 3.2. Quality attributes

- What are the quality requirements for the system that drive the design of the architecture?
- Which scenarios can be used to check whether the system meets the quality requirements?

A good way to express quality attributes in both a measurable and traceable way, is by using architecture scenarios which can be written in the following form (either as bullet points or as a table).

#### 3.2.1. Scenario name (Scenario ID) <!-- omit in toc -->

- Priority: High (High, Medium, Low)
- Status: Open (Open, Ready, Implemented). _Further options may be useful. The set of states should be defined at the beginning of the project._
- Environment: _Context and/or initial situation applying to this scenario_
  - _Quantification (if applicable), i.e. measurable effects applying to the environment_
- Stimulus: _The event, trigger or condition arising from this scenario_
  - _Quantification (if applicable), i.e. measurable effects applying to the stimulus_
- Response: _The expected reaction of the system to the scenario event (black box view putting no constraints on the design)_
  - _Quantification (if applicable), i.e. measurable effects applying to the response and/or measurable indicators that the scenario has been achieved by the architecture_

As table:

| Categorization  |                            |               |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| Scenario Name   | _Name_                     |               |
| Scenario ID     | _ID_                       |               |
| Priority        | _High, Medium, Low_        |               |
| Status          | _Open, Ready, Implemented_ |               |
| **Description** | **Quantification**         |
| Environment     | _Description_              | _Description_ |
| Stimulus        | _Description_              | _Description_ |
| Response        | _Description_              | _Description_ |

## 4. System decomposition

## 5. Architecture concepts

In this chapter, we describe how to achieve the functional and quality goals required by the architecture drivers.

### 5.1. Concept #1

We used the specific name of the solution concept as a heading, e.g. "Multi-tenancy concept", "Scalability", "Logging", "Testability", "Internationalization", "Monitoring", "Configuration", "Offline-usage and data synchronization".

#### 5.1.1. Architecture drivers

- Which drivers are addressed/implemented by this concept?

It is sufficient to insert references to the drivers (e.g. the scenario ID).

#### 5.1.2. Solution idea

- What is the idea with this concept?

We illustrate the idea with architectural views and accompanying text.

#### 5.1.3. Design decisions

- What fundamental design decisions have we made for this solution concept? E.g. architecture style(s), technologies, frameworks, strategies

#### 5.1.4. Discarded alternatives

- What alternative solution(s) did we discuss and discard?
- Why were they rejected?

### 5.2. Concept #2

Following the same scheme as for Concept #1, we describe further solution concepts here.

#### 5.2.1. Architecture drivers

#### 5.2.2. Solution idea

#### 5.2.3. Design decisions

#### 5.2.4. Discarded alternatives

## 6. Risks and technical debts

- Which design decisions are the riskiest, for example because they are based on assumptions that we have not or could not check thoroughly? Or because they use unknown solution concepts or technologies?
- Which past decisions have turned out to be inappropriate and should be revised?
- Which technologies have become obsolete?

## 7. Outlook and future plans

- What are possibilities for improvement?
- What advancements are planned?

## 8. Glossary

At last, we define terms that might be unclear to the target group of this document. Note that the extent and level of detail varies greatly depending on the level of knowledge of the target group. For example, it is not necessary to explain what a NoSQL database is to experienced developers, but it is more likely to be explained to management. Vice versa, there may be terminologies that are familiar to the business departments, but unknown to architects and developers.

_Term_: Definition, for example:

_CQRS_: Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation is a software design pattern that uses different data models and interfaces for write and read access of data. For more information, see [Martin Fowler's blog entry on the subject](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html).
